            <p>Good morning, afternoon or goodnight. Wherever you may be reading this,
                welcome to my first personal webpage!!! My name as stated above is Ryan Swartz. Im 28 years old born
                and raised in Kansas. I come from a family of 6, with 3 siblings. I am the third of four with two older
                brothers and one younger sister. I graduated from Kansas University with a bachelors in
                Economics in 2013. Over the past 5 years I have been working in Edgerton, KS at the BNSF Logistics Park
                Kansas City. </p>

            <p>I am currenlty working here in Chicago for GE's Transportation department. They are
                working on an intermodal automation algorithm. I am the subject matter expert for all things
                operations.
                But what truly brings me to the windy city is my passion for all things technology and more
                specifically coding.
                Thanks for joining me on this amazing journey and here goes nothing. </p>

            welcome to my first personal webpage!!! My name as stated above is Ryan Swartz. Im 28 years old born and raised
            in Kansas, unfortunately I do not know Dorthy or Toto. I graduated from Kansas University with a bachelors in
            Economics in 2013. Over the past 5 years I have been working in Edgerton, KS at the BNSF Logistics Park Kansas
            City. Its a state of the art intermodal facility spanning 400 acres with inital investments of 300$ million.
            During my tenure at LPKC I had the opportunity to work from the ground up, literally. I started off as a groundmen,
            followed by terminal operator, operations manager, senior operations manager, assistant terminal manager and
            lastly terminal manager. The railroad takes a unique approach for all employees by having them start at the ground
            mkdirlevel regardless of previous experience or degrees. I couldnt have been more thankful as it taught me invaluable
            lessons I dont believe I would have gotten any other way. It also had a unquie blend of desk time and yard time,
            allowing you to get to truly know your coworkers. To conclude it was an amazing 5 years but I always felt there
            was something else out there for me.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you can't tell I still have a passion for what I use to do for a living. However coding has always been more than a hobby.
            It's something I would do after a 60+ hour week on the railroad. Its something I would find myself doing in college
            instead of Economics homework at times. It's something I have a true passion for and its what brought me to Chicago
            for this class and future opportunities field. I couldn't be more excited and ready to start this next chapter.
            So once again thanks for visiting my webpage, wish me luck & here goes nothing!
